# JetSpeed

**JetSpeed** allows you to test the speed of your internet connection.

## 🎯 Aim
- Making a sample project with Compose UI.
- Reviewing performance concerns.
- Create and understand differences between stateless and stateful composable functions.
- Understand recomposition

## ⚒️ Build With
- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) - First class and official programming language for Android development.
- [Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html) - For asynchronous and more..
- [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) - Jetpack Compose is Android’s recommended modern toolkit for building native UI. It simplifies and accelerates UI development on Android
- [Flow](https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines.flow/-flow/) - A cold asynchronous data stream that sequentially emits values and completes normally or with an exception.
- [Android Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture) - Collection of libraries that help you design robust, testable, and maintainable apps.
    - [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) - Stores UI-related data that isn't destroyed on UI changes.
    - [DataStore](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/datastore) - Allows you to store key-value pairs or typed objects with [protocol buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers).
- [Dependency Injection](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection) -
    - [Hilt-Dagger](https://dagger.dev/hilt/) - Standard library to incorporate Dagger dependency injection into an Android application.
    - [Hilt-ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-jetpack) - DI for injecting `ViewModel`.
    - [Hilt-Navigation](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/libraries#hilt-navigation) - DI for injection Compose.
- [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) - A type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java.
- [Moshi](https://github.com/square/moshi) - A modern JSON library for Kotlin and Java.
- [Moshi Converter](https://github.com/square/retrofit/tree/master/retrofit-converters/moshi) - A Converter which uses Moshi for serialization to and from JSON.
- [Navigation Component](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/navigation-getting-started) -
    - [Navigating with Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/navigation) - You can navigate between composables while taking advantage of the Navigation component’s infrastructure and features.
